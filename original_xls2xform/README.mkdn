`xls2xform` is a Python script designed to make writing surveys for
Open Data Kit a snap. To start, check out some files in `example_xls`
to get an idea of the survey language accepted by the script.

To use the script run the following command:

    python xls2xform.py file.xls

This creates an xform for each worksheet in surveys.xls (excluding the
sheet named "Select Choices", which describes multiple choice
options).


How to use `xls2xform` with Open Data Kit
-----------------------------------------
I need to get surveys up and running on the phones.

1. Design survey. What questions does this survey intend to answer?
   What survey data is needed to answer these questions?
2. Write survey in Excel survey language described on
   http://xform.childcount.com
3. Convert the Excel file into XForms for Open Data Kit on
   http://xform.childcount.com
4. Log in to [an ODK Aggregate server](http://childcount.appspot.com)
   and upload your XForms. There are two options if you receive an
   "Error: Form Already Exists for this Namespace/Id attribute". You
   can delete the form that already exists on the server and try
   uploading your form again (deleting the form deletes all data that
   has been collected for this form). Or you can give your form a new
   name, change the name of the corresponding excel worksheet and go
   back to step 3.
5. Download the XForms to the phone from http://childcount.appspot.com
6. Enter data on the phone

Technical Notes
===============

Embedding this app in a django project
--------------------------------------
urls.py:

    from django.conf.urls.defaults import *
    
    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        (r'^', include('project-name.xls2xform.urls')),
    )

In the Production App, urls.py is not used to serve static
content. All static directives set in urls.py need to be transferred 
over to the Apache configuration file in order to work with mod_wsgi.

Shortcut for working with the Android emulator
